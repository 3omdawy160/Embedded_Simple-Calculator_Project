# Embedded_Simple_Calculator_Project

This is an Embedded field related project, which is done by the Layered model and drivers,

This is a Simple Calculator made by a KeyPad, LCD and controlled by an AVR ATMEGA16 microcontroller,

This Project is consisted of the following drivers:
LCD , Keypad , GPIO , and (std_types and common macros) libraries,

It's made to perform one mathematical operation at a time (ex: 36*753),

The two operands the user is entering will be displayed on the LCD,

Also the result will be displayed on the LCD for one second and the LCD will be cleared to be ready for a new operation,

And for the simulation on proteus, follow this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hUknklf9xXDGLTCgpjcPX-tNbIH9np5T?usp=sharing.
